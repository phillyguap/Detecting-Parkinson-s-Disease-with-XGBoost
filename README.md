# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease-with-XGBoost
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.
In this Python Machine learning project, we will build a model using which we can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body.
Project idea was pulled from data-flair.training

## What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

## What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

## Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost – Objective
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

## Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost – About the Python Machine Learning Project
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier. We’ll load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.


# Summary
In this Python machine learning project, we learned to detect the presence of Parkinson’s Disease in individuals using various factors. We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives us an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.
